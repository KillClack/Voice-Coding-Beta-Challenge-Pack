## 5. Ask Context Questions
- [ ] Ask Cody for a file's purpose, function docstrings, or to summarize the dataset schema in `sample.json`.

## 6. Collaborative Voice Room
- [ ] Simulate joining a voice room and editing a file simultaneously with another tester (describe or act out the workflow).

## 7. Dictate Documentation
- [ ] Use voice input to add/edit docstrings or README notes in Python, JS, or Markdown.

## 8. Highlight & Act: select code and ask Cody to comment or refactor
- [ ] Highlight lines in any file and ask Cody to:
    - Add docstrings or inline comments
    - Refactor a function

Each checklist helps you explore hands-free, conversational workflows. **Tip:** Make sure you end any command with "CodyGo" to let Coduy know you are done with your request. You can say, for example, "Cody select lines 10‚Äì15 in `app.js` and add JSdoc comments for each function. CodyGo". Remember when not in use tell Cody to cleep "CodySleep" so cody knows to stop listening. You can also mute the microphone or disconnect the seesison with the end call icon - you will need to reconnect in order to access Cody again once disconnected. Feedback welcome!
